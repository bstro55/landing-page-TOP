I completed this project as part of The Odin Project curriculum in the Flexbox section of Foundations.

Through this project, I learned key concepts around html, CSS, and Flexbox, and how they work together to create a functional webpage. I'm sure this will prove to be an extremely basic example, and my webpage is certainly not perfect, but I'm happy with how much I learned during this project. It will serve as a baseline for my skills as I move forward to a deeper learning on Flexbox, CSS, HTML, and soon, Javascript.
